Deploy multiple T-Shirt sized VM's
Before I started this project I assumed that it would be a simple task of creating code to auto-deploy T-Shirt sized VM’s in any “Cloud”, with the caveat that it must not cost any money. Well that threw me for a loop, as I have no cloud account (this would cost money), where I am currently employed we have just started looking at the value of moving to the “Cloud”, thus no access. So I went about this project trying to understand more than just writing a script. This would involve more of the where, why and how of this project scope.
